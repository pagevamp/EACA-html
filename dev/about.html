Founded in 1950, Eastern quickly grew from its 66 classrooms and student population of 1,500. Today Eastern ranks in the top five best high schools in Jefferson County with its 2,200 students and 88 classrooms. Over the years, Eastern has developed a strong academic track combined with a plethora of technology classes and partnerships with companies such as IBM, Dell and Microsoft. In addition, Eastern's athletic teams have earned state recognition, with the Varsity Basketball Team ranking first in the state during the 2010-2011 season. Today, we continue to grow as not only a school, but as a community.",
