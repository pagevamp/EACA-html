                            Eastern High School has been a pillar of the Middletown community for over 70 years. As one of the largest public high schools in the state of Kentucky, Eastern has touched students and their families’ lives numbering into the hundreds of thousands. Given this kind of scope, it’s hard to believe that there has never been a functioning alumni association to keep people connected- not only to the school, but to the community and each other. The Eastern Alumni & Community Association (EACA) was formed to fill that void. By re-connecting with thousands of Eastern alumni through events, a robust web strategy and regular communications, we feel strongly that we can re-establish the kind of pride in Eastern that made it the great institution so many remember fondly. In the short term our intention is to raise money to complete some basic facility renovations and improvements to give our teachers, administrators, and our kids back the ability to function at a basic level. But in the long term our goal is to create a competitive advantage for Eastern as an elite high school in the state- both academically and athletically.
